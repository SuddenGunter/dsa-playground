# 155. Min Stack

Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

Implement the MinStack class:

    MinStack() initializes the stack object.
    void push(int val) pushes the element val onto the stack.
    void pop() removes the element on the top of the stack.
    int top() gets the top element of the stack.
    int getMin() retrieves the minimum element in the stack.
```C
/*
 * Your MinStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * obj := Constructor();
 * obj.Push(val);
 * obj.Pop();
 * param_3 := obj.Top();
 * param_4 := obj.GetMin();
 */
 ```


# Solution
This can be solved using two stacks: one to store actual values and another to store min values.
My solution implements stack using doubly linked list and it's pretty slow.
Other stack implementations might work better.
